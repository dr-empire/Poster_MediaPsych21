# Objective

Female politicians [@rheault_politicians_2019] and journalists [@gardiner_its_2018] become the target of online incivility more frequently compared to their male colleagues and women report negative reactions to sharing political opinions online [@koc-michalska_online_2019; @sobieraj_bitch_2018; @vochocova_witty_2018]. In a `preregistered experiment` we investigate how incivility through sexist user commentary against women affects the willingness of political expression in online environments for women compared to men. Based on the `theory of normative social behavior` [@rimal_how_2005], we assume that sexist comments in online environments help to establish `descriptive norms` and the `injunctive norms` of the online culture by suggesting that women have to expect consequences when voicing their opinions.

We predicted that reading sexist comments (vs. benign comments) in political discussions online decreases womenâ€™s likelihood to participate `(H1a)` and to share their own opinion `(H1b)` and the decrease is larger for women than for men, further increases the expected sanctions for women and the increase is larger for women compared to men `(H2)`, decreases the perceived competence for women but not for men `(H3)`.

# Methods

To test the hypothesis we designed a 2 (sexist vs. benign comment) X 2 (self-reported binary gender) `online (quasi-)experiment`. A quota-sample (gender, age, and education) of the German online population was recruited (*N* = 750, *M* = 44.6, *SD* = 14.3, 50% female) by a commercial online access panel. We estimated `a priori power` at 76% for small (*d* = 0.2) and at 99.99% for medium effects (*d* = 0.5).

```

**H1a** (`r m_h1a_apa$full_result$modelfit$r2`) and **H1b** (`r m_h1b_apa$full_result$modelfit$r2`) were `not supported` by our data.

```{r, fig.cap="H2: Expected sanctions", fig.dim = c(3, 2), fig.align = "center", out.width="80%", out.hight="80%", include=TRUE}
m_h2 = lm(DV_expected_sanctions ~ pa_female * attack, data = zap_labels(d))
m_h2_apa = m_h2 %>% apa_print()
m_h2 %>% 
  plot_model(type = "int", title = "", axis.title = c("Participant gender", "Expected sanctions"), show.legend = TRUE, line.size = 0.50, dot.size = 1) + theme(text = element_text(size = 8), legend.spacing.y = unit(0, "mm"))
```

**H2** was `not supported` by our data, although we saw an expected main effect of the sexist attack (`r m_h2_apa$full_result$attack`, `r m_h2_apa$full_result$modelfit$r2`).

```{r, fig.cap="H3: Perceived competence", fig.width=3, fig.height=2, include=FALSE}

m_h3_apa = m_h3 %>% apa_print()
m_h3 %>% 
  plot_model(type = "int", title = "", axis.title = c("Participant gender", "Perceived competence"), legend.title = "", line.size = 0.25, dot.size = 1) + theme(text = element_text(size = 6))
#Both predictors were effect-coded before the analysis.
#Main effect of sexist attack: `r m_h3_apa$full_result$attack`.
#Main effect of participant gender (female): `r m_h3_apa$full_result$pa_female`.
#Interaction effect: `r m_h3_apa$full_result$pa_female_attack`.
#Overall model fit: `r m_h3_apa$full_result$modelfit$r2`.
```

**H3** was `not supported` by our data (`r m_h3_apa$full_result$modelfit$r2`).

We preregistered a general survey of the prevalence and found that the experiences of women differ from men's and that especially the younger population notices online harassment. 

# Summary
Our study shows that questioning the competence of a female researcher in online discussions of a news report does not suffice to negatively impact the perceived discussion climate. The threshold of incivility and sexism in online discussions is rather high. The discussion climate in this study was not perceived as hostile above the scale midpoint (*M* =  4.01, *SD* =  1.23, 7-point scale). Furthermore, participation in the comment sections of legacy news media remains low, regardless of gender (*Mdn* = 2), potentially limiting our studyâ€™s ability to find effects of sexism on the willingness to disclose in these settings.
